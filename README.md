octave2048
==========

This is 2048 game clone for Octave/Matlab. Its main use is the study of playing algorithms.

How to run one game session:

    >game_random

or

    >game_corner

or

    >game_corner2

or

    >game_greedy

Following runs all algorithms 100 times and produces some diagrams about effectivess of each algorithm:


    >game_plot

The game was tested in Octave, but probably runs in Matlab as well.
